' ========== NOTES FOR CLARIFICATION ==========

note right of UC1
  Entry point: Customer
  initiates transaction
end note

note right of UC4
  Core fraud detection using:
  - Rule-based logic
  - Machine Learning models
  - Velocity checks
end note

note right of UC6
  Risk Score: 0-100
  Thresholds determine
  alert/action levels
end note

note bottom of UC9
  Triggered when risk score
  exceeds configured threshold
  Sends multi-channel alerts
end note

note right of UC14
  Automated retraining pipeline
  uses labeled feedback from
  fraud analysts
end note

note left of ExternalDB
  External fraud intelligence
  database for pattern
  matching and validation
end note

note left of NotificationSvc
  Multi-channel notifications:
  SMS, Email, Push
end note
